            I possess a two-year track record in crafting and architecting
             software solutions. Presently, my focus revolves around the
             development of web applications, leveraging technologies such 
             as React, NextJS, PostgreSQL, and Prisma. Additionally, I am 
             adept at utilizing web-based platforms and services such as 
             Git and GitHub in my work.
